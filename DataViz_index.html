<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has filed a lawsuit against Navient Solutions alleging that the loan servicer illegaly mislead and failed to inform borrowers of repayment options and changes.</p>

<p>Not only did Navient provide bad information when borrowers reached out for help, they also: processed payments incorrectly; failed to act when borrowers complained; illegally cheated many struggling borrowers out of their rights to lower payments, causing them to overpay for their student loans; deceived private student loan borrowers about requirements to release their co-signer from the loan; and harmed the credit of disabled borrowers, including severely injured veterans.</p> 

<p>"For years, Navient failed consumers who counted on the company to help give them a fair chance to pay back their student loans," said CFPB Director Richard Cordray in a statement. "At every stage of repayment, Navient chose to shortcut and deceive consumers to save on operating costs. Too many borrowers paid more for their loans because Navient illegally cheated them and today's action seeks to hold them accountable."</p>
